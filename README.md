[**Hash Transformer**](https://github.com/siba2893/Personal-Libraries/blob/master/Rails/hash_transformer.rb) -> Allows the parameter comunication between Rails and any JS framework to be simpler by parsing automatically the parameters that are being send to the Frontend into camelCase and parsing the parameters coming from the Frontend into the backend to snakeCase.
